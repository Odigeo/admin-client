== Admin Client

The Admin Client is used to administrate the system. Written in [OceanFront][https://github.com/OceanDev/oceanfront], it allows administrators to manage all resources and all data in the system. It runs on stationary computers, on laptops and on mobile devices and features easy management via drag-and-drop and a modern UX design. The Admin Client can be extended by users to fit the administration needs of any system, or serve as a template for other, more specialised administration tools.
